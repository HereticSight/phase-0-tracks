1. The main philosophy of Linux is that it never assumes the user is incompetent. This means that Linux aims for the egalitarian approach, and treats every user equally. It gives every user full power and will let the user do anything, whether it is unintentionally bad or not.

2. A Virtual Private Server is a virtual machine, an emulated computer system (i.e. it is a computer that exists purely in a computer's memory, but may implement different hardware and software configurations that may or may not mirror the physical machine itself), that is offered as a service by an Internet Hosting Service. It runs its own copy of an operating system and allows the user superuser-level access (which means the user can install any software the OS can run). The VPS is the functional equivalent to a dedicated physical server, but since it is created with software, it is often easier to create and configure. The performance of a VPS may be lower than that of a dedicated physical server since it may be sharing resources with other VPSs on the same hardware.

3. Running programs as the root user is a bad idea since it allows access to all files on the system. If there happens to be a malicious program, signing in as the root user would allow the program to access all files on the system, whereas signing in as a user would only allow the program to access the home folder.
