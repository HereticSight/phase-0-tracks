# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* *What is version control? Why is it useful?* Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. It is useful because it allows us to view any changes made and who made them. In addition, it allows us to roll back any mistakes that may have been made.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a "copy" of a project that you are working on. You do most of your work on a branch so that you can keep the clean condition of the master branch, since that is very likely to be the most stable version of the project. This way, if multiple people are working on the same project, changes will not constantly happen while work is progressing.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a command to create a save point for a project. A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when a merge is performed, but there are disagreeing changes. This can happen when there are two completely different changes to the same part of a file. Another instance this may occur is when one branch completely removes a file, while another branch makes an edit to the file.
