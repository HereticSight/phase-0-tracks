    <p><strong>Gong Fu Tea, an active way to have tea</strong></p>
    <p>Gong Fu Tea is a good way to enjoy some of the more expensive teas since it emphasizes <em>taste</em> and <em>aroma</em>. 
    <br>The main differences between the two are as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>The teapot is very small, often around ~100ml to 200ml
    <li>The leaf-to-water ratio is very high
    <li>The steep time is extremely short, sometimes starting from 5 seconds.
    </ul></p>
    <p>My preferred teas to drink using the Gong Fu Tea Method are:
    <ol>
    <li>Pu-erh
    <li>Oolong
    <li>Black Tea
    <li>White Tea
    </ol>
